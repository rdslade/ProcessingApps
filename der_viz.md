The concept of derivatives is a prevalnt topic when introducing calculus as well as an essential piece of advanced mathematics. While differentiation explains many funamental concepts familiar to most people ([displacment and it's derivatives in physics](http://wearcam.org/absement/Derivatives_of_displacement.htm), [maximizing cost](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/BusinessApps.aspx), etc.), it is often introduced with confusing formulas and proofs that are unfamiliar to students getting introduced to calculus.
